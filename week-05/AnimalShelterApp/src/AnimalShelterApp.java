  Hey guys! I’m sorry that I haven’t sent you OO practice exercise yet.
1. If you haven’t solved the Garden application by yourself, do that.
2. If you haven’t solved the Aircraft carrier exercise by yourself, do that
3. If you haven’t solved the Pirate exercise till you can fight with ships, do that
4. If you done all of that (you shouldn't care about the exam ;)), create an animal shelter application where
- animals can be stored in a list
- animals can be adopted by people
- one person can adopt many animals, but one can be adopted by only one person
- if an animal is adopted, it is no longer listed in the shelter, but belongs to the
 adopter person, and the owner of the animal is also stored in the animal object

I’ll have some free time tomorrow afternoon, you can find me in GF. Contact me if you’d like me to help in anything then.
