Material Review
* Path and Paths.get() - we have them in Java 2008 …Path is a variable type, it contains data, and Path.get() is a method, it already exist, we
																				don’t need to create it with new
* Files - we have them both in the past and in the new Java

* readAllLines()

* write()

* Compile time error - this is translation exception - no default errors - compile error means sg is not readable for the computer in my code

* Runtime error

* Syntax error and compile error are the same

* Semantic error and runtime error are the same

* Exceptions

* Exception types - Intelli J will tell me which type of exception to use
	we can also create new types of exceptions… we will just need it later on though

* try - this is the testing

* catch - this is where i catch the exceptions

* finally - before java 8 you always had to close the file, after you used it… and you did the closing of the file @finally
	you put finally after catch and that line will always execute …now we are not using the files just the Path (terminology), so now it just opens the file
	when we read it and then it closes it, the same with write
	so we won’t really use this finally part just the try catch part
