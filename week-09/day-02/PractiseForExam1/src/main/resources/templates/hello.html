    <!--  And at the bottom of the page we have added an additional js file.
    We could also have added this to our HEAD element, but the problem is that
    if our javascript file wanted access to, for example, jquery, then it would fail,
    as jquery isnâ€™t defined until the end of the page. By adding it to this fragment,
    our javascript file (/js/hello.js) is the last file to be evaluated by the browser
    (after jquery and bootstrap are initialised). -->
